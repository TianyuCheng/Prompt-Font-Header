Prompt-Font-Header
==================

This repository is created for [PromptFont](https://shinmera.github.io/promptfont/),
which is designed for button prompts (especially for games).

It already comes with headers for multiple language bindings.
This repository is presenting the headers in a different style,
similar to [IconFontCppHeaders](https://github.com/juliettef/IconFontCppHeaders).
